<h3 id="general-jajuk-teams-trac-rules">General Jajuk Teams trac rules</h3>

<p>Following rules apply to tickets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Please create a ‘Task’ ticket even for small changes</li>
  <li>When closing a ticket: please provide a comment. If the ticket is referring to other tickets (especially for <em>duplicate tickets</em>), please give the tickets references in your comment. You can easily search for other tickets with trac search function.</li>
  <li>Tickets not related to the Jajuk software itself (server works, promotion, tools…) should not have assigned version or milestone number (set void version and void roadmap).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="todo-after-a-fix-or-a-feature-coding">TODO after a fix or a feature coding</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If not already done, assign ticket to yourself (so we know did what)</li>
  <li>Close the ticket once done (it is sometimes difficult to know if a ticket is done when a lot of ticket are still opened)</li>
  <li>For bugs, write as a comment on which branch (usually trunk and last maintenance branch) you applied the fix so we don’t have to check this later.</li>
  <li>For bugs to fix on several branches : please fix only the maintenance branch, not trunk as we will merge all changes on the maintenance branch to trunk at each fixpack release.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="github-issues-administration">Github issues administration</h3>

<p>Manage Milestones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The default <strong>Milestone</strong> must be set to <em>“To Be Qualified by Jajuk Team”</em></li>
  <li>When releasing a new Jajuk version, the current <strong>milestone</strong> version must be closed</li>
</ul>

<p>Manage Versions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>version</strong> must be created per already released version</li>
  <li>The default <strong>version</strong> must be set to <void> to force users to select a release</void></li>
  <li>When releasing a new Jajuk version, the current <strong>version</strong> must be created</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="version-rules">Version rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Jajuk releases follow this version scheme: <major>.<minor>.<fix>. Example: 1.1.4 : Fourth fix release of second minor release of first major release.</fix></minor></major></li>
  <li>When starting a minor release testing process (about one or two months), we create a specific branch used for fixes (during this time, commiters can continue to work in the trunk). Example: one month before 1.1 official release, a “1.1” branch is created. All fixable bugs found against minor version are double-fixed in the release and in the trunk branches (fix against maintenance branch, then fixes are merged into trunk). For example, an issue discovered in 1.1 is fixed in the ‘‘1_1 ‘‘branch AND in the trunk (1.2 development release).</li>
  <li>Major and minor releases are maintained during a single minor releases (for example, 1.1 is maintained until 1.2 is released) and a fix pack release (x.y.z) is released ASAP if critical bug found or about every one or two weeks for minor issues.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="code-names">Code names</h3>

<p>Codenames in Jajuk refers to songs names that have been performed by different artists but this is not an absolute rule. No more than two or three words easy to remember and eventually to pronounce worldwide.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1.11: Deepest Blue by Deepest Blue</li>
  <li>1.10: Gute Laune by Tosca</li>
  <li>1.9: Killer Queen by Queen</li>
  <li>1.8: Breathless by Shankar Mahadevan</li>
  <li>1.7: Firestarter by Prodigy</li>
  <li>1.6: Summertime, composed by George Gershwin</li>
  <li>1.5: Lothlorien By Enya, from Shepherd Moons album</li>
  <li>1.4: Aerodynamic by Daft Punk</li>
  <li>1.3: My Dear Country, from Norah Jones, album Not Too Late </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="release-process">Release process</h2>

<p>The Jajuk release process usually takes from 8 to 10 weeks.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The release process is announced with a message in the developer mailing list (make sure you subscribed to this list). The version branch is then created and all developments are then frozen in this branch (however, it is still possible to work on the next version in trunk). English labels are frozen as well to allow translators to start working.</li>
  <li>Translators can complete their translations during the entire process. Note that translators can work on current releases even outside release process periods.</li>
  <li>Testers qualify and developers fixes bugs discovered during this period. An e-mail is send on developer list at each Release Candidate.</li>
  <li>When we find the last RC stable enough, it is released as a final on Sourceforge and a maintenance branch is created. We wait at least 2 days between last RC and final release</li>
  <li>The communication delegate sends the news in Freshmeat and other web sites after one week without critical issue</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="user-documentation">User documentation</h2>

<p>Jajuk is now a pretty large software using a few relatively advanced concepts like perspectives &amp; views, custom properties or devices. As a developer, you will obviously have to know and understand the application concepts. All of them are described in the <a href="http://jajuk.info/manuals.html">User guide</a>, please make sure to read it in depth.</p>
